# Modded Intel Galileo Board

A platform was built to the intel galileo board so that it can support the add-ons it has, network, power manager.

### It was used
- thin steel sheets
- 2 18650 batteries
- dual usb 5V 1a 2.1a power bank charging module
- heat sink ~30mm
- 5v 30mm fan
- spst 2 pin switch
- usb port
- m3 steel standoff

The heatsink was taped with double-sided tape, ensuring that it makes contact with the silicon,
the fan is connected to 3.3v, and can be connected to a diode to control the speed.

m3 steel standoff steel was used to elevate the board, and it was applied insulating tape between the board and the steel sheets to avoid short circuits.

since the board works at 5v you can use the circuit of a power bank

a switch was placed between the board and the usb connect, and a usb port was added to avoid using an otg cable.

can be used with batteries and plug-in power at the same time, in case any of them stop working, the other one will keep it on.
